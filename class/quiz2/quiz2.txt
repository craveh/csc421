1a) Although different mechanisms might be involved to implement the hierarchy,
   I have schedulable tasks in a priority hierarchy. Please list for me that
   hierarchy. 
   
1b) What is prioritized by the priority of this list.

2) Give a short defintion of the three basic concepts for scheduling:
   a- concurrency
   b- efficiency
   c- latency
   
3) Among the types of scheduling classes are preemptible tasks and run-to-completion
   tasks. Explain the difference, with a sample reason a task would be of one class
   or another. 
  
4) Some tasks run in user-contest, and some in system context. Explain what these
   contexts are and give an example tast that runs in each of the contexts.
   
5) Considering interrupt tasks, what is the top and the bottom of the task, and why
   are interrupt tasks divided this way? Give an example.
   
   The example can be something you suppose might be true but illustrates the 
   concept. You do not need to find an actual, in code, example.
